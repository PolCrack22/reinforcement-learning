## Introduction

The "FrozenLake" environment poses a challenge where an agent must traverse a frozen lake to reach the goal. Due to the slippery nature of the environment, movement is stochastic, making it a great case study for reinforcement learning.

This project uses Q-learning, a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm, to find an optimal policy for the agent.

## Objectives

1. Understand the structure of the FrozenLake environment.
2. Implement and train a reinforcement learning agent using Q-learning.
3. Evaluate the agentâ€™s performance through success rates and learning curves.

---

## Methodology

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - The environment is configured using OpenAI Gym.
   - The state and action spaces are defined based on the environment.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - **Q-learning**: A tabular approach to approximate the value of state-action pairs iteratively.
   - **Epsilon-Greedy Strategy**: Balances exploration and exploitation during the learning process.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Training progress is tracked by analyzing the Q-values and the agent's success rate.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Key metrics, such as learning curves, are plotted to illustrate the agent's improvement over time.
